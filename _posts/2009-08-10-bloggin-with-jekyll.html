<h2>Allright, again. But why?</h2>

<p>I often play around with different blogs, writing my own, using different approaches. I have to admit, it's fun for me, building new sites and testing new frameworks.</p>

<p>For my &ldquo;<em><a href="http://optimiere.com" title="Softwareentwicklung">company</a>&rdquo;
</em> page I wrote lots of code, which had to be refactord and simplified. Writing code is good, but starting over and over from scratch, using good old rails erb first, then <a href="http://haml-lang.com/" title="#haml">#haml</a>, adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)" title="Sass (stylesheet language) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">sass</a>, using <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" title="Blueprint: A CSS Framework | Spend your time innovating, not replicating">blueprint</a> and finally <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/" title="Yahoo! UI Library: Grids CSS">yui grids</a>. Trying out some <a href="http://openid.net/" title="OpenID">openid</a>, <a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master" title="binarylogic's authlogic at master - GitHub">authlogic</a>, <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master" title="technoweenie's restful-authentication at master - GitHub">restful-authentication</a> stuff, is cool, but all my posts are gone and links get broken. Aaahhhwwww poor me :)</p> 

<p>Well, it's not that important what I wrote, but somehow it would be nice to have all my posts back again (I bet they are still out there, but spread over different databases). I never backed them up, because I didn't give a Shit about it. But somehow, growing older means getting more sentimental :D So, here is my solution:</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master" title="mojombo's jekyll at master - GitHub">Jekyll</a>, an awesome ruby gem, that allows me to create blog posts from my beloved <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="TextMate — The Missing Editor for Mac OS X">texteditor</a>. A plus on nerdfactor regarding my way of hacking stuff. No more lame textfields in browsers. And as another plus, all my posts in plain text on my favorite social coding platform <a href="http://github.com/" title="Secure source code hosting and collaborative development - GitHub">github.com</a>.</p>

<p>Sounds great, doesn't it? Next question is, what to use to write the actual text? <a href="http://hobix.com/textile/" title="Textile Reference">textile markup</a> doesn't feel so natural to mee. Maybe I'm going to have a look at <a href="http://github.com/remi/maruku/tree/master" title="remi's maruku at master - GitHub">maruku</a> soon. Read somewhere it somehow talks to <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" title="LaTeX project: LaTeX &ndash; A document preparation system">LaTeX</a>, that would be yummi :D</p>

<p>That&#x27;s a start :)</p>
